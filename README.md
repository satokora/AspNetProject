This project is to create an information management system that stores and provides information about auction items donated for a local charity auction event. 
The system let users sign-in, donate items, retrieve item information, register bidders, manage payment status, and produces reports about items and buyers. The web-based system is developed in C# using ASP.NET. 
In order to improve efficiency of group development, our group selected MVC class structure and divided workload into each member. For user-interface design, we selected Semantic UI in order to create responsive, and aesthetically pleasing pages.
